# COVID-Data-set-Analysis
Use data analysis techniques to explore, transform and visualize covid-19 statistical data.

This project is divided into three parts:

For the first axis, we will use SQL to do data mining using a sequence of data imported from the website: ourworldindata.org.

For the second axis, we will take some of the SQL queries we worked on in the first part and create some great visualizations in Tableau.

For the third axis, we will clean up the data in SQL.
